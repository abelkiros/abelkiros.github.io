											<h2>Abel Kiros አቤል ኪሮስ </h2>
										</header>
										<p>Welcome! I'm Abel, born in Rochester, New York, and of Ethiopian descent. My educational journey began at Monroe Community College before I transferred to the esteemed Rochester Institute of Technology, where my passion for technology and creativity found its true calling.

											As an aspiring professional in both cybersecurity and software development, I'm endlessly intrigued by the boundless opportunities that technology presents.
											
											In the realm of cybersecurity, I aim to focus on fortifying digital landscapes against threats, specializing in penetration testing, network security, and risk assessment. Simultaneously, I'm honing my software skills to create innovative solutions that redefine our interaction with technology.
											
											Beyond the digital realm, I proudly support the Arsenal Football Club, finding immense joy in the camaraderie and excitement of the sport. When I'm not immersed in the world of football, I channel my creativity through art—whether it's sketching, painting, or experimenting with digital designs. Exploring diverse cultures and their intricacies is another passion; I relish learning about different traditions, languages, and customs, fostering a deeper understanding of our wonderfully diverse world.
											
											Amidst this array of interests, I hold a profound interest in learning about my culture and roots. Delving into Ethiopian heritage, understanding its rich history, traditions, and values is a journey close to my heart. This exploration further enriches my understanding of myself and the world around me.
											
											Sports remain a constant in my life. Whether I'm experiencing the competitive rush of a game or relishing the focus of a solitary run, sports keep me energized and grounded.
											
											My aspiration extends beyond personal growth—I am driven to inspire and empower. I strive to uplift my friends, family, and community, sharing knowledge, fostering ambition, and encouraging everyone to reach greater heights.
											
											Join me on this multifaceted journey as I navigate through the intricate landscape of technology, blending creativity, a fascination for diverse cultures, an unwavering enthusiasm for the beautiful game, a commitment to exploring my roots, and a dedication to inspiring positive change.</p>
