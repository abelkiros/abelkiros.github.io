											<h2>Welcome!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a Tigrayan-American born in Rochester, New York. My educational journey commenced at Monroe Community College and later led me to the esteemed Rochester Institute of Technology, 
											where my passion for technology and creativity blossomed. As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I am fascinated by the limitless opportunities that technology offers.</p>

											<p>
											My aim is to fortify digital landscapes against threats, specializing in penetration testing, network security, and risk assessment. Concurrently, I am refining my software skills 
											to pioneer innovative solutions that redefine our interaction with technology.
											</p>
											
											<p>
											Beyond the digital realm, I derive immense joy from the camaraderie and excitement that sports bring. When not engrossed in athletics, 
											I express my creativity through various art forms—sketching, painting, or experimenting with digital designs. Exploring diverse cultures 
											and their intricacies captivates me; I relish learning about different traditions, languages, and customs, fostering a deeper understanding of our wonderfully diverse world.
											</p>
											
											<p>
											Within this myriad of interests, delving into my Ethiopian heritage holds a special place. Understanding its rich history, traditions, 
											and values is a deeply personal journey that further enriches my understanding of both myself and the world around me.	
											</p>
											
											<p>
											Sports remain a steadfast presence in my life. Whether experiencing the camaraderie of a game or relishing the focus of a solitary run, 
											sports keep me energized and grounded. My aspirations transcend personal growth; I am driven to inspire and empower. Striving to uplift 
											my friends, family, and community, I aim to share knowledge, foster ambition, and encourage everyone to reach greater heights.

									<h3>Home Lab Running Crypto Mining Rig</h3>
									<p>The implementation of the crypto mining rig crafts a fusion of hardware and software meticulously designed to tackle the complex computations inherent in cryptocurrency mining. 
										This setup features a carefully selected ensemble of high-performance GPUs, strategically arranged within a well-ventilated space and complemented by efficient cooling systems 
										to maintain optimal operating temperatures. On the software side, meticulously configured mining algorithms, wallets, and monitoring tools are orchestrated to harness the 
										maximum computational prowess of the rig. My build validated transactions, contributed to blockchain security, and generated revenue for me.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
									<h3>Python Implementation Keylogger</h3>
									<p>
										This project involves the development and implementation of a Python-based keylogger—a discreet software designed to record and log keystrokes on a computer system. 
										Operating stealthily in the background, it captures user inputs without their awareness. The keylogger securely stores this data, providing insights into keyboard activity. 
										This explores the intricacies of keystroke capture and storage, showcasing Python's capabilities in monitoring and logging user interactions within a controlled software environment. </p>
								</li>
