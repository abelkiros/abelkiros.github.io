											<h2>Hi, I'm Abel!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											<h3>About Me</h3>

											<p>
												I'm an IT professional with over 2 years of experience and I'm currently working at the University of Rochester 
											Medical Center part of the overnight IT support team for ISD. Additionally, I have a background in computer science 
											from RIT which equipped me with an array of skills including scripting and programming solving skills.

											</p>
											<h3>What Motivates Me</h3>

											<p>I am a highly motivated person, constantly striving for self-improvement in all aspects of life—including my health, skills, 
											and relationships. I take pride in my work and am passionate about learning and developing my expertise in this field.
											While planning is important, I've found that in IT and programming, it's best to take action and "just do the thing." This 
											approach not only builds confidence but also allows us to add value through experimentation and discovering effective solutions 
											when working in teams. This mindset drives me to work on labs and personal projects outside of work to refine my craft and sharpen 
											my skills. It's similar to how I approach training—trying to improve a little each day. I have a particularly strong interest in 
											cybersecurity and cloud computing.
										    </p>

											<h3>My Passions and Values</h3>
											<p>I take pride in my work ethic and discipline. Growing up, my family instilled in me the importance of education and strong values. 
											Visiting Ethiopia broadened my perspective of the world and taught me about the sacrifices my family made to provide my siblings 
											and me with opportunities for a better life. These experiences sparked my desire to rise above mediocrity. There's a saying in 
											Amharic, "አንበሳ" (anbessa)," which translates to "heart of a lion." No matter what adversities we face in life, it's essential to 
											stay focused and positive, do the necessary work, and let the results speak for themselves. I enjoy learning about different 
											traditions, languages, and customs, which deepens my understanding of our diverse world.
											My aspirations extend beyond personal growth—I am motivated to inspire and empower others. I aim to uplift my friends, family, 
											and community by sharing knowledge, fostering ambition, and encouraging everyone to strive for greater heights.</p>
